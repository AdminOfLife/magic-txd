This is the AMD_Compress tool that is available from 

http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/amdcompress

It is used for native texture compression and decompression that is based on
a special proprietory format of AMD (formerly known as ATI).

NOTE: this is a STRIPPED DOWN version of the libraries!
