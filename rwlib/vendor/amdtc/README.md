This is the Compressonator tool that is available from 

https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/Compressonator

It is used for native texture compression and decompression that is based on
a special proprietory format of AMD (formerly known as ATI).

Since Compressonator is open-source, you can compile the latest binaries yourself.
Due to the massive size of the Compressonator source code we are distributing binaries only.

NOTE: this is a STRIPPED DOWN version of the libraries!
